Simple functionnality, but yet very usefull way to listen to Quran verse by verse, specially for people trying to revise/memorise some verses, this plugin tries to let you use the functionnality with an easy interface, with a support for both RTL and LTR directions and a bilingue form.

The plugin switches automatically the languages and direction based on your wordpress installation

Supports Arabic and English (and therefore most of latin languages)
You can select an interval of verses to play
define the number of times each verse will be repeated
You can also repeat the whole interval as many times as you want by setting this functionality to ON.

A nice paging and a progress bar is there to help you know the current and already played verses from the interval you selected
